    deliberately does not go through modules/data or Secrets Manager (see
    that module's README). When set, user-data writes it to
    /etc/app/db-ca.pem on the instance and exports DB_CA_CERT_PATH, which
    the app resolves for TLS verification (see api/secrets.js in a rehosted
    service repo). Left empty ("") for a DB that doesn't require TLS --
